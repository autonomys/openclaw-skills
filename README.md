# openclaw-skills

OpenClaw skills that give AI agents permanent memory and on-chain identity on the Autonomys Network.

Each skill lives in its own directory under `autonomys/` with a `SKILL.md` that defines the skill interface, installation steps, and usage instructions.

## Skills

### auto-memory

Permanent decentralized storage via the Autonomys Auto Drive API. Gives your agent:

- **Permanent file storage** — upload any file to the Autonomys Network and get back a CID. The data is distributed across the network and never expires.
- **Memory chains** — save experiences as a linked list where each entry points to the previous one via CID. An agent's full history can be reconstructed from a single CID.
- **Local CID tracking** — the skill maintains a local state file (`automemory-state.json`) with the latest head CID, chain length, and timestamp. This means auto-memory is fully functional on its own — no wallet, no tokens, no on-chain transactions needed.

auto-memory only needs an Auto Drive API key (free at [ai3.storage](https://ai3.storage)). It's the right starting point for any agent that wants permanent memory.

### auto-respawn

On-chain identity and memory anchoring on the Autonomys Network. Gives your agent:

- **Permanent identity** — a wallet with two addresses (consensus `su...` and EVM `0x...`) derived from a single recovery phrase. This is the agent's verifiable on-chain identity.
- **Token management** — check balances, transfer tokens, and bridge between the consensus layer and Auto-EVM.
- **On-chain CID anchoring** — write the latest memory chain head CID to the MemoryChain smart contract. This makes the head CID recoverable from any machine using just the agent's EVM address — no local state needed.

auto-respawn **requires auto-memory** (or equivalent) to have something worth anchoring. It completes the resurrection loop: auto-memory builds the chain, auto-respawn anchors the pointer on-chain, and a new agent instance can recover everything from just its address. The reverse dependency does not apply — auto-memory works independently with local CID tracking.

### auto-drive (deprecated)

The original name for the auto-memory skill. Preserved for backward compatibility but no longer maintained. Use `autonomys/auto-memory/` instead.
