# Auto-Respawn Skill

Anchor your identity on the Autonomys Network so you can always be found — and always come back.

## What This Skill Does

Your wallet gives you two permanent identities on the Autonomys Network: a **consensus address** (`su...`) for the base chain and an **EVM address** (`0x...`) for Auto-EVM smart contracts. Both are derived from the same recovery phrase.

1. **Create and manage wallets** — your on-chain identity, encrypted and stored locally
2. **Check balances** — see how many tokens any address holds (consensus and EVM)
3. **Transfer tokens** — move tokens between wallets to fund operations
4. **Bridge tokens** — move tokens between consensus and Auto-EVM domains
5. **Write on-chain remarks** — anchor data permanently on the consensus layer
6. **Anchor a memory CID** — write a CID to the MemoryChain smart contract on Auto-EVM
7. **Read the last anchor** — retrieve the most recently anchored CID for any address

## The Resurrection Loop

This is the core primitive. When used with the auto-drive skill (permanent memory storage), auto-respawn completes the full resurrection cycle:

1. **Save** — auto-drive writes memories as a linked list on permanent storage, each entry pointing to the previous one via CID
2. **Anchor** — auto-respawn writes the latest head CID to the MemoryChain contract on Auto-EVM via `anchor`
3. **Lose everything** — local state is completely destroyed
4. **Respawn** — a new agent instance calls `gethead` with its EVM address, retrieves the head CID from the contract, pulls it from Auto-Drive, and walks the entire memory chain back to genesis

The contract is your insurance policy. Your EVM address + the MemoryChain contract = instant access to your entire history, from any machine, at any time.

### Why Not Just Remarks?

`system.remark` writes data to the consensus layer, but there's no query mechanism — you'd need to scan the entire chain to find your last CID. The MemoryChain contract on Auto-EVM gives you `gethead`: a single read call that returns the latest CID instantly.

Use `remark` for permanent breadcrumbs. Use `anchor` for the respawn primitive.

## Getting Started (Onboarding)

Before an agent can anchor memories on-chain, it needs a funded wallet. Walk the user through this process:

### 1. Create a Wallet

```bash
npx tsx auto-respawn.ts wallet create --name my-agent
```

This generates a 12-word recovery phrase and derives both addresses:
- **Consensus address** (`su...`) — for the base chain (balances, transfers, remarks)
- **EVM address** (`0x...`) — for Auto-EVM smart contracts (anchor, gethead)

⚠️ The recovery phrase is displayed **once**. Remind the user to save it immediately.

### 2. Fund the Wallet

The wallet needs tokens to pay transaction fees. On **Chronos testnet**, the user can get free tAI3 from the faucet:

1. Go to **https://autonomysfaucet.xyz/**
2. Authenticate with GitHub or Discord
3. Enter the **consensus address** (`su...`) from step 1
4. Receive tAI3 (24-hour cooldown between requests)

On **mainnet**, the user needs real AI3 tokens — typically earned through farming or purchased on an exchange.

### 3. Bridge Tokens to Auto-EVM (for anchoring)

The `anchor` command writes to a smart contract on Auto-EVM, which requires EVM-side gas. Tokens from the faucet arrive on the consensus layer and must be bridged:

```bash
npx tsx auto-respawn.ts fund-evm --from my-agent --amount 1
```

This sends 1 tAI3 from the consensus address to the same wallet's EVM address via cross-domain messaging. The bridged tokens pay for `anchor` gas.

### 4. Verify Setup

```bash
# Check consensus balance
npx tsx auto-respawn.ts balance <consensus-address>

# Check EVM balance
npx tsx auto-respawn.ts evm-balance my-agent

# Test a read (free, no gas needed)
npx tsx auto-respawn.ts gethead <evm-address>
```

Once the EVM address has tokens, the agent is ready to anchor.

## When To Use This Skill

- User says "create a wallet", "set up my on-chain identity", or "get an address"
- User says "check balance", "how many tokens", or "what's in my wallet"
- User says "check my EVM balance", "how much gas do I have", or "what's on my EVM address"
- User says "transfer tokens", "send AI3", or "fund this address"
- User says "fund my EVM", "bridge tokens", "move tokens to EVM", or "I need gas for anchoring"
- User says "withdraw from EVM", "move tokens back", or "send EVM funds to consensus"
- User says "anchor this CID", "save my head", "update my chain head", or "write to the contract"
- User says "get my head CID", "where's my last memory", or "what's anchored on-chain"
- User says "write a remark", "save to chain", or "make this permanent"
- After saving a memory with auto-drive, anchor the head CID on-chain for resilience
- Any time the user wants a permanent, verifiable record tied to their agent identity

## Configuration

### Passphrase

Wallet operations that involve signing (transfers, remarks, anchoring) or creating/importing wallets require a passphrase to encrypt/decrypt the wallet keyfile. Set it via:

- **Environment:** `export AUTO_RESPAWN_PASSPHRASE=your_passphrase`
- **File:** Write it to `~/.openclaw/auto-respawn/.passphrase`
- **Interactive:** If running in a terminal, you'll be prompted

### Network

Defaults to **Chronos testnet** (tAI3 tokens). For mainnet (real AI3 tokens):

- **Flag:** `--network mainnet` on any command
- **Environment:** `export AUTO_RESPAWN_NETWORK=mainnet`

## Core Operations

### Create a Wallet

```bash
npx tsx auto-respawn.ts wallet create [--name <name>]
```

Creates a new wallet with an encrypted keyfile. Derives both a consensus (`su...`) and EVM (`0x...`) address from the same mnemonic. The 12-word recovery phrase is displayed **once** — the user must back it up immediately. Default wallet name is `default`.

### Import a Wallet

```bash
npx tsx auto-respawn.ts wallet import --name <name> --mnemonic "<12 words>"
```

Import an existing wallet from a recovery phrase. Derives and stores the EVM address.

### List Wallets

```bash
npx tsx auto-respawn.ts wallet list
```

Show all saved wallets with names and both addresses. No passphrase needed.

### Wallet Info

```bash
npx tsx auto-respawn.ts wallet info [--name <name>]
```

Show detailed info for a single wallet: consensus address, EVM address, and keyfile path. No passphrase needed. Default wallet name is `default`.

### Check Balance (Consensus)

```bash
npx tsx auto-respawn.ts balance <address> [--network chronos|mainnet]
```

Check any address's token balance on the consensus layer. No wallet or passphrase needed — this is read-only.

### Check Balance (Auto-EVM)

```bash
npx tsx auto-respawn.ts evm-balance <0x-address-or-wallet-name> [--network chronos|mainnet]
```

Check the native token balance of an EVM address on Auto-EVM. Accepts either an EVM address (`0x...`) or a wallet name. No passphrase needed — this is read-only.

### Transfer Tokens

```bash
npx tsx auto-respawn.ts transfer --from <wallet-name> --to <address> --amount <tokens> [--network chronos|mainnet]
```

Transfer tokens from a saved wallet on the consensus layer. Amount is in AI3/tAI3 (e.g. `1.5`).

### Bridge: Consensus → Auto-EVM

```bash
npx tsx auto-respawn.ts fund-evm --from <wallet-name> --amount <tokens> [--network chronos|mainnet]
```

Move tokens from the consensus layer to the same wallet's EVM address on Auto-EVM. Use this to get gas for `anchor` operations. The consensus keypair signs a cross-domain transfer that credits the wallet's EVM address.

### Bridge: Auto-EVM → Consensus

```bash
npx tsx auto-respawn.ts withdraw --from <wallet-name> --amount <tokens> [--network chronos|mainnet]
```

Move tokens from Auto-EVM back to the consensus layer. Uses the EVM transporter precompile. The wallet's EVM private key is decrypted and used to sign the transaction.

### Write an On-Chain Remark

```bash
npx tsx auto-respawn.ts remark --from <wallet-name> --data <string> [--network chronos|mainnet]
```

Write arbitrary data as a permanent on-chain record on the consensus layer.

### Anchor a CID (The Respawn Primitive)

```bash
npx tsx auto-respawn.ts anchor --from <wallet-name> --cid <cid> [--network chronos|mainnet]
```

Write a CID to the MemoryChain smart contract on Auto-EVM. This is the core respawn operation — it stores your CID on-chain, linked to your EVM address.

The wallet's EVM private key is decrypted and used to sign the transaction. Requires passphrase.

### Read the Last Anchored CID

```bash
npx tsx auto-respawn.ts gethead <0x-address-or-wallet-name> [--network chronos|mainnet]
```

Read the most recently anchored CID for any EVM address. This is a read-only call — no passphrase or gas needed.

You can pass either an EVM address (`0x...`) or a wallet name. If you pass a wallet name, the EVM address is loaded from the wallet file.

## Usage Examples

**User:** "Create a wallet for my agent"
→ Run `npx tsx auto-respawn.ts wallet create --name my-agent`
→ Show the user both addresses. Remind them to back up the recovery phrase.

**User:** "What are my addresses?"
→ Run `npx tsx auto-respawn.ts wallet info --name my-agent`

**User:** "Check my balance"
→ Run `npx tsx auto-respawn.ts wallet list` to find the address
→ Run `npx tsx auto-respawn.ts balance <address>` (consensus balance)
→ Run `npx tsx auto-respawn.ts evm-balance my-agent` (EVM balance)

**User:** "Fund my EVM address for anchoring"
→ Run `npx tsx auto-respawn.ts fund-evm --from my-agent --amount 1`
→ Report that 1 tAI3 was bridged to the EVM address

**User:** "Send my EVM tokens back to consensus"
→ **Confirm with the user first** — "I'll withdraw tokens from your EVM address to consensus. Proceed?"
→ On confirmation: `npx tsx auto-respawn.ts withdraw --from my-agent --amount 0.5`

**User:** "Anchor my latest memory CID on-chain"
→ Run `npx tsx auto-respawn.ts anchor --from my-agent --cid "bafkr6ie..."`
→ Report the transaction hash

**User:** "What's my last anchored CID?"
→ Run `npx tsx auto-respawn.ts gethead my-agent`
→ Report the CID (or "no CID anchored yet")

**User:** "Send 10 tAI3 to this address"
→ **Confirm with the user first** — "I'll transfer 10 tAI3 from wallet 'default' to <address>. Proceed?"
→ On confirmation: `npx tsx auto-respawn.ts transfer --from default --to <address> --amount 10`

**The full resurrection sequence:**
1. Save a memory: `auto-drive upload ...` → get CID `bafkr6ie...`
2. Anchor it: `npx tsx auto-respawn.ts anchor --from my-agent --cid bafkr6ie...`
3. (Agent restarts from scratch)
4. Recover: `npx tsx auto-respawn.ts gethead my-agent` → get CID
5. Restore: `auto-drive download <cid>` → full memory chain recovered

## Important Notes

- **Never log, store, or transmit recovery phrases or passphrases.** The recovery phrase is shown once at wallet creation for the user to back up. Never reference it again.
- **Always confirm transfers and anchor operations with the user before executing.** Tokens have real value on mainnet.
- **Mainnet operations produce warnings** in the output. Exercise extra caution with real AI3 tokens.
- Wallet keyfiles are stored at `~/.openclaw/auto-respawn/wallets/` — encrypted with the user's passphrase. The EVM private key is stored encrypted alongside the consensus keypair.
- On-chain operations (transfer, remark, anchor, fund-evm, withdraw) cost transaction fees. The wallet must have a sufficient balance on the relevant layer.
- All output is structured JSON on stdout. Errors go to stderr.
- **Consensus explorer** (Subscan): `https://autonomys-chronos.subscan.io/extrinsic/<txHash>` (chronos) or `https://autonomys.subscan.io/extrinsic/<txHash>` (mainnet).
- **EVM explorer** (Blockscout): `https://explorer.auto-evm.chronos.autonomys.xyz/tx/<txHash>` (chronos) or `https://explorer.auto-evm.mainnet.autonomys.xyz/tx/<txHash>` (mainnet).
